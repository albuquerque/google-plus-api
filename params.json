{"name":"Buffer to Google+ Hook with Casper.js","tagline":"A nodejs script/daemon that will connect with Buffer API and post to google+ when new updates were submitted via buffer","body":"##How does this work?\r\nIf you've ever wondered why buffer does not share to google+, it's because google+ doesn't have an publicly available API.\r\n\r\nUsing Casper.js, the script opens google+ sharing page in a hidden(headless) browser, and posts the update received from buffer API.\r\n\r\n\r\n##Requirenments\r\n\r\n- Node.js\r\n- Phantomjs\r\n- Casperjs\r\n\r\n##Setup\r\n- Clone the repo\r\n- Make sure you have casperjs on your path - ``casperjs --version``\r\n- Install npm requirenments - ``npm install``\r\n- Obtain a buffer __Access Token__\r\n    - Go here : [Buffer Developer site](https://bufferapp.com/developers/apps/create)\r\n    - Create an example app, and copy the __Access Token__ you receive \r\n    - Wait 2 min and go to [http://bufferapp.com/developers/apps](http://bufferapp.com/developers/apps) to obtain your Access Token.\r\n- Save __example_config.json__ as __config.json__ and edit it with your Access Token, Google+ Username and password.\r\n- In the __service__ field, choose to which of your buffer accounts this script will listen. Can be one of `twitter`, `facebook`, `linkedin`\r\n\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"buffer_conf\": {\r\n        \"service\": \"linkedin\",\r\n        \"access_token\": \"BUFFER_ACCESS_TOKEN\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"google_conf\": {\r\n        \"email\": \"YOUREMAILHERE\",\r\n        \"password\": \"YOURPASSWORDHERE\"\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n - This script requires your google __username/password__, but as it's running locally, it's not a HUGE security risk, just a mild one. \r\n\r\n##Running the server\r\n```bash\r\nnode app.js\r\n```\r\n\r\n##Installing as a service on mac osx\r\n```\r\nsudo node mac_daemon.js install\r\n```\r\nThis will install the node server as a damon on your mac, that should work and reset itself on fails / restarts. \r\nThis requires sudo priveleges.\r\n\r\nAfter service is Installed, logs can be viewed in ``/Library/Logs/Buffer to Google+/buffertogoogle.log``\r\n\r\nTo uninstall the server ``sudo node mac_daemon.js uninstall``\r\n\r\n##Why?\r\nThis was done as a proof of concept. Getting Casperjs script to post to google was challenging and it was fun. \r\n\r\n##Desclaimer\r\nWHile this code doesn't do anything harmful like saving your password (check for youself, it's all here), it doesn't stop someone from accessing your computer and reading the config.json.\r\n###USE AT YOUR OWN RISK\r\nI'm not responsible for any damages that using this script may provide you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
